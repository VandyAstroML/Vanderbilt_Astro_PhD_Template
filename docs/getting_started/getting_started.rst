**Author**: `Victor Calderon <http://vcalderon.me>`_ (`victor.calderon@vanderbilt.edu <mailto:victor.calderon@vanderbilt.edu>`_)

**Description**: An easy, reasonably standardized, but flexible template for 
creating Ph.D. theses from 
the `Vanderbilt University <https://www.vanderbilt.edu/>`_

This documentation is part of the repository
`Vanderbilt Ph.D. Thesis - Cookiecutter <https://github.com/VandyAstroML/Vanderbilt_Astro_PhD_Template>`_

Whenever you're getting close to finishing your Ph.D., you will eventually 
have to start writing up your dissertation. There are many templates 
out there, but there has been one template passed around between  
Astronomy graduate students at Vanderbilt *from generation to generation*.
